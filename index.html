            me! My name is Kayla and I am brand new to the tech world. I am looking forward to learning a lot and becoming the best coder I can! I grew up in the Portland Metro area and love the city and everything it has to offer. Growing up I've always wanted to help my community in any way that I'm able to, I'm hoping to find a job that will allow me to do my part in this. I'm a queer vegan always looking for the next adventure!

    Background:
    </h2>

     <p>
    I graduated from Ridgefield highschool and for a while after I went to Clark College to learn early childhood eductation where I also played on the softball team. My time at Clark was short, unfortunatly I had to make the choice between continuing my education and getting a job to provide for myself. A few years later I went through culiary school and lit up my love for cooking and eating. I have had many jobs! Most of which were in kitchens either cooking or serving however I have worn many hats! I was a flight attendent for a year, scaffold errector, driver dispatcher for UPS, a house cleaner, lifeguard, and babysitter! It's been a lot of learning new skills and trying to find where I fit in. I'm passionate that people should be treated and compensated fairly in their workplace. My friend went to PSU for computer programming and last year started a new job at New Relic. He's taken me to the office for a couple of socials and I knew this was the kind of life I've been wanting to live. I met his team mates and they told me about Epicodus a programming boot camp that they went through, so I had to check it out! I did a workshop with them in early December thinking there's no way <em>I</em> could code... right? Wrong! It's not something that I ever saw myself doing yet here I am and loving it so far! I can do whatever I put my mind to and I'm putting my mind to becoming the best programmer I can be!
