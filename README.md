#### By Ms Kayla Elizabeth Weaver

#### This is where you can learn all about my and my projects!

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS

## Description

_This browser allows you to scroll through and read my portfolio with my about me, hobbies, projects, etc. All of the Github examples are clicable and will take you to my projects

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your desktop by clicking the <> code button and copying the url
* navigate to the top level of your desktop and copy git clone "url-of-remote-repo"
* A new file should open up on your desktop containing my super amazing awesome project

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_

## Known Bugs

* I'm having trouble aligning the bullet points after I centered the text
